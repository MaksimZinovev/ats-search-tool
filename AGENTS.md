BLOCKS. Scripts in this repo are reusable blocks in .blocks/. Rules:
1. Check the block index below first. If a block fits, run it. If one almost fits, add a param to it.
2. A script you would run twice, or over ~10 lines, becomes a block, not a heredoc or a /tmp file.
3. Inputs are params. No hardcoded paths, ids, ports or dates.
4. Print one small JSON object: the answer, not the data. Filter, count and truncate in code.
5. Exit 0 on success, non-zero with {"error": ...} on failure.
6. Safe to re-run: idempotent, no prompts, cleans up after itself.
7. Header first: name, summary, params, effects, example. caveman-blocks lint checks it.
8. Compose: call existing blocks with caveman-blocks run instead of copying their code.
